=================

Adventures learning and messing with NXP's LPC800 Series ARM Cortex-M0+ Microcontrollers using open-source tools.

###programs I'm using:
  - The `arm-none-eabi` open source ARM development toolchain with gcc, gdb, size, etc.
  - `lpc21isp` a small command line utility for Linux that is used to flash firmware onto NXP LPC ARM chips over a serial connection using their built-in bootloader.
